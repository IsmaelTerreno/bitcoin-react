# Bitcoin Reactjs tool
- Create buttons to accept bitcoins via QR codes.
- Customize QR codes with a fixed amount to show when scan the client.

To use this component in your reactjs project just import the following:

`import { BitcoinQR } from '@ibunker/bitcoin-react';`

And the base styles :

`import '@ibunker/bitcoin-react/dist/index.css';`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
and [create-react-library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-react-library). I do recommend those libraries for some magic ;).
